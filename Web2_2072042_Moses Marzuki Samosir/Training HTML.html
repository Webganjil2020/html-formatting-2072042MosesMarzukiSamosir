In visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed—
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.
<br> 
Ah! what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?
<br>
That holy dream—that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding.
<br>
What though that light, thro' storm and night,
So trembled from afar—
What could there be more purely bright
In Truth's day-star?
